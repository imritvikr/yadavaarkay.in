                            Hi! <br /><br />
                            I am Ramakant Yadav, Software Engineer by profession, trying to explore many things, one at a time.
                            <br /><br />
                            I graduated from IIT Ropar, India in 2020.  I explored various things during my college days and coding was one of them. 
                            I am fascinated by the digital revolution and the power of technology. I enjoy working on products which aims to ease our life through technology. 
                            I am very curious about the digital revolution and currently I am trying to dive deep into the digital world and
                            itâ€™s revolutionary innovations(Blockchain, ML/AI, Metaverse and Crypto etc.). 
                            <br /><br />
                            I enjoy writing down my thoughts, which gives me time and space to process deep-seated emotions. Be it poetry, short story or a movie review,
                            I give them words that come right from my heart. In my spare time I create content for my YouTube channel(Business case studies, entrepreneurship, personal finance etc.).
                            I like reading non-fiction, watching thriller and biography, listening rock(and pop) and working out. Always up for bike trips.
                            <br /><br />
